# Url Builder Plus

This package servers as a drop-in replacement for the [Url.Builder](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/url/latest/Url-Builder) module found in [elm/url](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/url/latest/), except that it has been extended with the following functions to make it more convenient to use:

  - [`nonEmptyString`](UrlBuilderPlus#nonEmptyString)
  - [`float`](UrlBuilderPlus#float)
  - [`bool`](UrlBuilderPlus#bool)
  - [`maybe`](UrlBuilderPlus#maybe)
  - [`list`](UrlBuilderPlus#list)
  - [`bracketedList`](UrlBuilderPlus#bracketedList)
